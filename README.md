# Welcome to my Github page #

#### My name is Owen Tushan, and I am a current student at Southern Methodist University, pursuing a major in Computer Science as well as a major in Data Science. I am interested in the field of data science and data analytics, and I am looking to get an internship for the summer of 2025, and I think I would be a good fit at your company. ####

Looking at my Github repositories, you will find the projects that I am currently working on as well as the projects I have completed. Below is an outline of the projects contained in  this repository


- Sentiment Analyzer:
  
  A project in C++ that takes in a CSV of tweets (or X's?) and trains itself based on if the tweet is considered "positive" or "negative", taking this into account for every word used in the tweet. After this training, it tests on another set of tweets. Using the trained data of what words are considered positive or negative, it determines the sentiment of a new tweet.


- Search Engine:


- Artificial Intelligence Mobile App:

  This is an iOS app that I made in SwiftUI, with the purpose of being able to ask a Large Language Model (LLM) ethical questions. The app has a multitude of functional pages, including an extensive set of login pages with forgot password and reset password options. Once logged in, you are able to ask the app any ethical question you want, or opt for a preset ethical question. You can then tell the app if you want it to answer ethically for, neutrally, or against the ethical dilemma. Finally, the app connects to ChatGPT, asking it the question and gathering the response in the app for the user to read.
