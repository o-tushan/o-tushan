# Welcome to my Github page #

#### My name is Owen Tushan, and I am a current student at Southern Methodist University, pursuing a major in Computer Science as well as a major in Data Science. I am interested in the field of data science and data analytics, and I am looking to get an internship for the summer of 2025, and I think I would be a good fit at your company. ####

In my Github repository, you will find the projects that I am currently working on as well as the projects I have completed. Below is an outline of the projects contained in  this repository


- Sentiment Analyzer:
  
  A project in C++ that takes in a CSV of tweets (or X's?) and trains itself based on if the tweet is considered "positive" or "negative", taking this into account for every word used in the tweet. After this training, it tests on another set of tweets. Using the trained data of what words are considered positive or negative, it determines the sentiment of a new tweet.
